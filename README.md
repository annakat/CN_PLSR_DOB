# PLSR_DOB
PLSR models for predicting foliar carbon and nitrogen content from fresh leaves, carbon fractions and pigment concentrations from fresh leaves
(measured in-situ)

## Contains:
1) PLSR model: final model coefficients (_coeffMEAN), coefficient statistics (_coeffSTD), graphical output model statistics (.jpg)

2) Two example PLSR model fitting R scripts: PLSR_quick (for testing), PLSR_iter (with iterations, used for the final models)

3) Example dataset for model development (example_data_for_model.csv)

4) R script showing how to apply the PLSR models to new observations: predictions.R

5) Example dataset for model predictions (example_data_for_preds.csv)
